Each box is on its own row, stacking on top of each other.

### Ex. 2 - Lets make some boxes
Lets turn our container into a flex container.

```html
<!-- Code Snippet -->
<div style="display: flex">
    <div class="box red"></div>
    <div class="box blue"></div>
    <div class="box yellow"></div>
    <div class="box orange"></div>
    <div class="box green"></div>
    <div class="box blue-violet"></div>
    <div class="box salmon"></div>
</div>
```

All we did was add display flex on the container div. Now all of our boxes are on the same line.
